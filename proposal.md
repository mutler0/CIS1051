# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Chimp Tribulation

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A rigged version of the chimp test which is when numbers show up on the screen and then disappear and you have to press where they were in order.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I plan to use either pygame or unreal to make this interactive game. The idea of the chimp test is that a chimp has done this test and is pretty good at it. At the start, there will be a minimum of 5 numbers scattered on the screen each in a square. Similar to the chimp test, the first trial is just clicking the numbers in order without them disappearing. Once that is completed, the rounds actually starts. Once #1 is clicked, the rest of the numbers with the squares disappear and turn into regular squares. The user has to click on the squares in the order of the numbers that were there. Every time they click all the squares in order of the numbers they move onto the next round adding a number. If the user messes up, the round starts over at the number they were at but they only get three chances. The rigged idea that I want to include is to make it harder for humans and chimps and exercise our brains a bit more. The numbers will not be like 1 2 3 4 like the actual chimp test but it would be in a pattern that has to be understood before beginning the round. Guessing would be a lot harder in this version.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I plan to accomplish an attempt of chimp test with a few bugs and the rigged portion would be a bit difficult.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be the perfect version of the chimp test.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish the rigged version of chimp test with a nice and unique interface.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research the basics of pygame and unreal and find out which would be best for my project. I will also need to develop my skills in one of the programs and which ever language it involves.
