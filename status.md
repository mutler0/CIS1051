#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have planned out what I have to do and gave myself a schedule. Tried to start the basis of the project but had a few setbacks, continuing to create the idea.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

The disappearing aspect of the numbers as well as the rigged portion.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

It was difficult to materialize what I had in my head mainly where I wanted to have the numbers but also when I wanted them to disappear.
