Code is in FreshmanFinal.

 This final project was surpiringly more difficult than I assumed it would be.
 It was very outside my comfort zone and challenging however I had fun creating it and overcoming obstacles.
 
Difficulties overcame:
  - Generating random position for the buttons without (ranked most challenging to least)
      1. the while function causing the buttons to randomly generate constantly
      2. overlapping of the buttons
      3. the pygame window being unresponsive because of another while loop
      4. all the blocks/buttons being visible on the screen
      5. skipping number/buttons
  - clicking the number/buttons in order
  - lives and amount variable
    - reseting the display when lives decrements or amount increments (kind of)
      - the amount still increments even if a life decrements
  - game over

Difficulties that still remain difficult:
  - the 'trial run' before it actually begins (1-4)
  - flipping or changing the colors of the buttons once one is clicked
    - this was beyond anything I knew or could research
        - didn't know how to change the color of all the buttons after they have been placed on the screen
  - reseting the int(self.text) 
    - outside of the class fucniton was impossible even with a variable and I had no idea how to do it inside the class 
        - this was so that when the display reset becuase of the lives or the amount was reached, it would start back at 1 instead of continuing to count             up from the last number
  - buttons still generate random positons randomly after 1 life is lost.
 
Overall this project was fun for me especially when I figured out something that had me stumped for hours on end. I enjoyed the problem solving aspect and researching topics to become more familiar. I learned a lot from this and would consider myself intermediately educated in pygame. I wish I was more capable and educated in pygame before hand so I could complete the game and then add a twist but I am still content with this outcome becuase it is a game that works, sometimes.
